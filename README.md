## How to Play

1. You will be prompted to choose one of the following options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The AI will also make a choice based on the selected difficulty level.
3. The game will determine the winner, and the result will be displayed.
4. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

## AI Strategies

The AI has three difficulty levels:

- **Easy**: The AI makes random choices.
- **Balanced**: The AI has an equal chance of choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Hard**: The AI tries to predict your moves. If it detects a pattern in your recent choices, it will counter your moves.
